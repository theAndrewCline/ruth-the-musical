            <h2>The Composer</h2>
            <img src="./assets/david-getz.jpg" alt="David Getz">
            <p>I have been composing for nearly my whole life. As a young kid taking piano lessons, I would often improvise
                on my assigned piano lessons, and through that process, I began to dabble in writing my own pieces. As I
                grew up, I became more and more interested in music theory and how that skill specifically helped me as a
                composer. When I was 14, my parents bought me a MIDI keyboard that connected to software on my computer that
                enabled me to compose at a much quicker pace. I would spend hours at a time at my computer writing my own
                pieces and arranging my favorite works for different instrumentation.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t until I attended Illinois Wesleyan’s Summer Composition Institute my senior year of high school that
                I understood the transformative power that comes from writing music for other human beings. The piano, clarinet,
                and cello trio that I wrote that summer took my musicianship to new heights, and I spent the next four years
                at that University continuing to explore the world of composition. My senior recital featured my first piano
                sonata as well as a brass quintet. Though I was studying to be a music teacher, I knew that I would be writing
                music the rest of my life.</p>
            <p>During my junior year of college, I sketched the first song for “Ruth: The Musical,” though, at the time, I had
                no concept of this show as a whole. It was while listening to Doug Habegger preach from the book of Ruth
                that I was taken by the emotional turmoil Elilmelech must have undergone during his decision to uproot his
                family from the Promised Land and move to Moab. I penned a few lyrics on my bulletin and thought, “I wonder
                if this story would make for a good musical?” Over the next seven years, this idea never died and I worked
                at the blistering pace of writing one or two songs a year. Even though I liked the concept, the idea of the
                show ever culminating in a performance remained a pipe dream.</p>
            <p>An event in the fall of 2017 served as the catalyst that inspired me to finish writing the show. In September
                of 2017, I performed in the company of my first musical theater production, Peoria Player’s production of
                “The Hunchback of Notre Dame.” The process of seeing a group of incredibly talented people all coming together
                for the sake of communicating a story to an audience was powerful and transforming. While I had always enjoyed
                musical theater as a consumer, I now saw its ability to serve from the other side of the stage, and I realized
                that the story of Ruth is one that everyone needs to hear.</p>
            <p>I made it a goal to finish the show by the end of the year, and by January 1, 2018, I had written every song
                but the finale. I went to work putting together a creative team to put on the show, and I was continually
                humbled by the incredible people who not only agreed to help, but did so with enthusiasm and eagerness. The
                show was completed in March of 2018, and the rehearsal process began that same month. I cannot believe how
                this process all came together, and I can’t wait for you all to see the show! - David Getz</p>

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>A man left Bethlehem and took his family to Moab. It was a disaster! While there, the man, Elimelech, died as
                well as his two songs, Mahlon and Kilion. His wife Naomi decided to go back to Bethlehem. Ruth, one of her
                daughters-in-law, said, “I’m going with you. Wherever you live, I will live. Your people will be my people.
                Your God is now my God.”
            </p>
            <p>So they went back and established their home in Bethlehem. Fortunately, poor people were allowed to go into the
                fields and pick up grain dropped during the harvest. So Ruth went to a field owned by a man named Boaz. He
                saw Ruth and found out who she was. He said to her, “Don’t go to any other field. The men here won’t hurt
                you. We’ve heard how well you’ve treated Naomi. May the Lord richly bless you.”
            </p>
            <p>That evening, Ruth tells Naomi about the kindness of Boaz. When she heard that name, she said, “Oh, Ruth, he’s
                a close relative of our family. Stay in his field, just as he said. You’ll be safe there.” So Ruth continue
                to work in the field of Boaz throughout the barley harvest and the wheat harvest.</p>
            <p>At the end of the harvest, Naomi said to Ruth, “When Boaz and his men are done working at the threshing floor,
                they’ll sleep there to protect the grain. Go there and do as I say, but don’t let the men see you.” So Ruth
                went to the threshing floor. Once the men were asleep, she quietly uncovered the feet of Boaz and lay down.
                During the night, he realized there was a woman lying at his feet. He said, “Who are you?” She said, “I’m
                Ruth. I’m seeking your protection because you’re my closest relative.”</p>
            <p>He said, “The Lord bless you! You are a woman of integrity. Still, there’s a next-of-kin who is closer than I.
                In the morning, I’ll talk to him and give him an opportunity to redeem you. If he doesn’t, I will.”</p>
            <p>The next day, Boaz met with the next-of-kin and the elders of the city. He said, “Naomi is selling her husband’s
                land. You can buy it, but if you do, you must also marry Ruth, the Moabite woman.” The man said, “You have
                my permission to buy the property.” The elders were witness to this transaction. So Boaz took Ruth as his
                wife, and they became the ancestors of David, the great king of Israel!</p>
